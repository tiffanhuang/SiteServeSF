     As I've presented, I have two cats. They're both the same age, but they're two entirely different breeds, gender, and they're just different in many ways.
      When they first met eachother, Thing 1 was really fussy, and would often attack Thing 2. Eventually, Thing 2 was able to fight back, and they got along in the end.
      </p>
       <p>
          Originally, I only had one cat, which was Thing 1. Thing 1 is a female Siamese cat. She joined our family during the summer of 2023, and has been living in my home since. She's mostly an indoor cat, and we occasionally let her out into our backyard, but with supervision (we can't have her running away). 
        People usually say that your first cat is usually an angel, and they're the reason for you to get a second cat, and I completely agree with that. I would say Thing 1 is such a intelligent, athletic, and, most importantly, healthy cat. She's really friendly, and isn't scared of guests.

     <b style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">Some fun facts about Siamese cats...</b> 
      <ul style="margin:30px;">
        <li>Color-Changing Coats: Siamese cats have coats that can vary widely in color, including silver-gray, orange, brown, cream, blue, and lilac. Interestingly, their coat color is influenced by temperature. A special modifier gene inhibits pigment development in their fur, but it only affects the fur above a certain temperature. When their body temperature drops, pigment returns to their fur, resulting in distinct markings around their faces, tails, and paws.</li>
        <li>Ancient Origins: Siamese cats are believed to have originated in Thailand around the 14th century. They appeared in a Thai manuscript, making them one of the oldest cat breeds globally. Their sleek bodies, striking blue eyes, and distinctive appearance have captured hearts for centuries.</li>
        <li>Quirky Traits: Legends surround Siamese cats’ unique features. Some had crossed eyes and kinked tails. One legend suggests that while guarding a royal goblet, Siamese cats stared at it so intensely that their eyes crossed. Wrapping their tails around the goblet led to permanently bent tails. Although less common today, some Siamese cats still exhibit these traits.</li>
        <li>Social Butterflies: Siamese cats are known for their sociable nature. They enjoy interacting with people and thrive on companionship. Their vocal tendencies make them excellent communicators, expressing their feelings through meows and chirps.</li>
        <li>Intelligent Creatures: Siamese cats are considered highly intelligent. Their playful and curious personalities keep them engaged with their surroundings. They love puzzles, toys, and mental challenges, making them delightful companions for those who appreciate their cleverness.</li>
      
      </ul>
    <br>
      <p style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">
        The second cat to arrive was Thing 2 (hence the name). He joined a little after a month after Thing 1, so I didn't get to see when it was a little little kitten. Thing 2 is the COMPLETE polar opposite of Thing 1. First things first, Thing 2 is a male cat who is really shy.
        He's really scared of guests, and when he first joined our family, he was also scared of Thing 1. I often found myself saving Thing 2 from being bullied from Thing 1. 
        I would say that Thing 2 is a bit slow in the head. Sure, he is really cute and dainty, but I know for a fact that he would not be able to survive in the streets. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">To be honest, I have no idea what breed this cat is, I've thought that is was some sort of Manx cat for the longest time ever, but now that I've looked more on cat breeds, a Cow cat seems more likely. </p>
      <b style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">With that being said, here are some fun facts about Cow cats...</b>
      <ul style="margin:30px; margin-top:0px;">
        <li>Unique Patterns: Cow cats have striking coat patterns that combine white fur with patches of another color, such as black, tabby, or colorpointed. These patterns resemble those found on cows.</li>
        <li>Cap-and-Saddle: One common variation is the “cap-and-saddle” pattern. It features a white body with a black patch on the back and head, resembling a saddle.</li>
        <li>Mask-and-Mantle: Another variation is the “mask-and-mantle” pattern. These cats have more black fur, creating a contrast with their white coat.</li>
        <li>Lively Personalities: Cow cats are known for their big personalities. They’re affectionate, playful, and make wonderful companions.</li>
      </ul>
